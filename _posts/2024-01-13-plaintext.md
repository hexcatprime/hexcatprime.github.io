I watched No Boilerplate's video on [plaintext][1] and thought I should seriously apply those principles to my projects. I was already veering that way with the creation of this website and teaching myself cool markdown tricks. Beginning work again also necessitates this change, I need to document my code while minimizing the time spent fussing with note-taking software.

### Some things I've done this week with markdown 
- Move documentation and admin of my video game off of Jira and Confluence
- Began using repo wiki feature for this website *(which is great because I would otherwise drown the blog page in website updates)*
- Began documenting my workflow at my job

markdown isn't a panacea, I'm helping my dad create a printed study aid for his students and I will probably have to use LaTeX. To my knowledge markdown does not have robust math features.
