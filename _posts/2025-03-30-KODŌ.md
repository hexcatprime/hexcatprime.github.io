I had the privilege of seeing KODŌ at the Boston Symphony Hall on March 9th. I had a wonderful time watching the drum performance and was moved by some of the last pieces. Towards the end of the show, one performer walked out onto stage and began hitting the giant drum that sat towards the back of the stage. He was alone and wearing just a cloth. After a couple minutes of his solo, the drum began responding to his beats. A reward for his efforts.

There is something beautiful about stripping yourself spare in pursuit of of a singular purpose. Watching the solo act felt poignant; The music is incredible, but my life has nothing worth pursuing as doggedly as the music to the drummer.
