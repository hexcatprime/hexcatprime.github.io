I completed my first project in Rust! 

I basically implemented a copy of [Steam Input](steam), replacing their virtual keyboard with a radial keyboard. I encountered many design challenges and have hopefully ironed out most of the kinks. You can read about the problems I encountered on the wiki page of the [repo](repo).

All of my schooling was in Java, so learning another explicitly-typed language wasn't difficult. I'm still learning to make full use of borrowing and immutability.

### What's Next?
I'm going to bring my video game project out of hiatus with Rust. Godot now has support for Rust with [godot-rust](godot) bindings. I've stalled many times trying to make a video game, so I'll be patient with myself.

If I return to this keyboard project I'll consider implementing these features next cycle:
- Config file for customization (requires file deserialization)
- GUI for key selection
- Controller rumble on zone change
- Fixing the mouse jitter bug
